# Simulation Sciences M.Sc. Portfolio

## Purpose

This repository is part of my academic work in the Simulation Sciences M.Sc. program at RWTH Aachen University.  
It documents numerical exercises, algorithm implementations, and analytical results related to:

- Numerical linear algebra
- Solvers for PDEs
- Finite element or finite volume methods

The content is intended as a demonstration of problem-solving approaches, coding practices, and scientific reporting.
